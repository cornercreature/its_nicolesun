        <p>ONCE upon a time a Hello World and a Hello World said "Hello World" to each other, and everything was beautiful until one Hello World became a smaller Hello World, which made the Big Hello World think it would become a small Hello World too if it didn't erase the Small Hello World from the face of this browser. So then Big Hello World becomes a monster and chases Small Hello World but its ok because Small Hello World becomes a SPEEDY RACE HORSE so then it outruns the monster. They run and run until a Table appears and then they run in the table, which makes the Horse think about Calendars, and then about the passing of time and what do you know, WOAH ITS A NEW YEAR! At least it is right now. So the Horse becomes a Chinese Horse and runs us into the new year, the horse year, but not before doing something about the monster. Specifically, by farting out the snake because the snake is the last year's zodiac animal and then the snake battles the monster and wins (duh) so now we can all have a new year with one less monster. And one more Happy New Year card. Nice. <br>

        Happy New Year!
